        <p>Hi, I am Kenneth! I am a Biomedical Science graduate from Queen's University, Belfast. I first started learning coding on a short Java course run by the Uni. Now, I have also picked up some other languages like Python, SQL and R.</p>
        <p>I like travelling and photographing(The pandemic really did help...). Feel free to follow me on my Instagram if you are intersted!</p>
